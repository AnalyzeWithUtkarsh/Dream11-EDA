# Dream11-EDA
In this project I analyzed the dream11 fantasy points of all the players who participated in IPL 2020.
The dataset contains the name, team, ground, points, runs, wickets and many other columns.
I have used SQL to analyze the dataset, EDA.
In this I have cleaned the data a little bit according to my needs and used advanced SQL concepts like Window functions, subquery etc.
