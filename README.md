# Dream11-EDA
As cricket fan and lover I wanted to work on the fantasy gaming dataset which is related to cricket, so I used an open source dataset from kaggle which is about the fantasy points system i.e Dream11 points of all the players who participated in IPL 2020.

In India cricket is so much loved and when IPL season comes up it is like a festival to all the cricket lovers and for those who make fanatasy teams on the apps. So I thought of answering few questions about the fantasy team games. The dataset contains the name, team, ground, points, runs, wickets and many other columns.

I imported the dataset in MS SQLServer and cleaned the dataset like removing null values, updating rows in the dataset, after this I performed the Exploratory Data Analysis EDA on the dataset using SQL. 

The questions that I answered during my analysis were
a) most points scored by players in the season
b) number of dismissal by count
c) number of players in each team
d) number of matches played at each ground of UAE
e) points scored by each ground in IPL 2020
f) players who scored more than 50 points most times
g) teams with most dream11 points
h) most points scored by player in one match at each ground
i) ground with players who scored most points
j) maximum wickets taken on each ground by player

With the help of these answers we got to know which ground is more batting friendly and which is bowler friendly, the fantasy players can make their team accordingly as which player has scored more 50+ points in the season so it would become easy to pick that player in the team which will help in better team combinations.

Moreover I used the advanced SQL concepts like window functions, subquery, aggregate functions, group by and having clause to complete the analysis.
